# Legend outside the figure

According to the documentation of Axes.legend() method, We can use the parameters loc and bbox_to_anchor to control the position of the legend. But the documentation for the two parameters are not very clear.

In plain words, bbox_to_anchor accepts a list of four values: (x0, y0, width, height). It will create a bounding box on the axes, inside which the actual legend will be put. The lower left coordinate of the bounding box is (x0, y0). Its width and height are given by width and height, respectively. Often, you will see that a list of only two values are given to bbox_to_anchor, which means that the width and height of the bounding box is zero.

The parameter loc denotes the alignment relationship between the actual legend box and the bounding box. It means that different position indicated by loc in both the legend box and bounding box will be put at the same point. For example, if loc='center', the center of legend box and the bounding box will be at the same point. If loc='center right', the center of the right edge of the legend box and the bounding box will be aligned (i.e., at the same point).

So much for the text. Letâ€™s take some examples to better illustrate the idea.



```

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.patches as patches
locs = ['upper right', 'lower left', 'center left', 'lower center', 'center',
        'right']
x0, y0, width, height = 0.5, 0.5, 0.1, 0.4
x = np.arange(0.1, 4, 0.1)
y = 1.0/x
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
idx = 1
for i in range(0, 2):
    for j in range(0, 3):
        ax = fig.add_subplot(3, 2, idx)
        ax.plot(x, y, label=r'$\frac{1}{x}$')
        ax.legend(loc=locs[idx-1], bbox_to_anchor=(x0, y0, width, height),
            edgecolor='g', fontsize='large', framealpha=0.5,
            borderaxespad=0)
        ax.add_patch(
            patches.Rectangle((x0, y0), width, height, color='r',
                            fill=False, transform=ax.transAxes)
        )
        ax.text(0.6, 0.2, s="loc = '{}'".format(locs[idx-1]),
        transform=ax.transAxes)
        idx += 1
plt.show()

```
